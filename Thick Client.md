# THICK CLIENT
A Thick Client (Fat Client) is a standalone application that interacts with a server but performs most of the processing on the client side. Common examples include desktop applications (Windows, macOS, Linux) built using technologies like Java, .NET, Electron, C++, etc.

##Here’s a comprehensive security checklist for performing thick client penetration testing (Pentesting).


### 🛠 Step 1: Information Gathering & Recon
Tools:
✅ Procmon (Process Monitor) – Monitor file, registry, and network activity.
✅ Wireshark – Capture and analyze network traffic.
✅ Burp Suite / MITMProxy – Intercept and modify HTTP/HTTPS requests.
✅ PEStudio – Static analysis of Windows executables.

Steps:
1️⃣ Identify the framework (.NET, Java, C++, Electron, etc.).
2️⃣ Monitor network requests (HTTP, WebSockets, TCP, RMI).
3️⃣ Capture registry interactions (Windows Registry modification).
4️⃣ Identify configuration files storing sensitive data.

### 🔑 Step 2: Authentication & Authorization Testing
Tools:
✅ Burp Suite – Modify API requests for authentication bypass.
✅ Mimikatz – Extract stored credentials.
✅ John the Ripper / Hashcat – Crack hashed passwords.

Steps:
1️⃣ Check for hardcoded credentials in binary/config files.
2️⃣ Test weak authentication mechanisms (default passwords, weak hash algorithms).
3️⃣ Attempt privilege escalation (modifying tokens, sessions, registry).
4️⃣ Look for JWT/API key leakage in logs, memory dumps.

### 📡 Step 3: Network Traffic & API Testing
Tools:
✅ Wireshark / TCPDump – Analyze TCP/UDP packets.
✅ Burp Suite / MITMProxy – Intercept and modify API calls.
✅ Fiddler – Decrypt HTTPS traffic.

Steps:
1️⃣ Capture unencrypted network traffic.
2️⃣ Look for API calls leaking sensitive data.
3️⃣ Test for MITM attacks (Weak SSL/TLS implementation).
4️⃣ Attempt API fuzzing to find vulnerabilities.

### 💾 Step 4: Local Storage & File Analysis
Tools:
✅ Procmon (SysInternals) – Monitor file changes.
✅ Strings (Linux/Windows) – Extract readable text from binaries.
✅ SQLite Browser – Analyze local database storage.
✅ HxD / Hex Editor – Modify binary files for privilege escalation.

Steps:
1️⃣ Check if passwords or API keys are stored in plaintext.
2️⃣ Analyze database files (SQLite, MySQL) for credentials.
3️⃣ Monitor log files for sensitive data.
4️⃣ Try modifying config files to escalate privileges.

### 💣 Step 5: Reverse Engineering & Code Analysis
Tools:
✅ IDA Pro / Ghidra – Reverse engineer binaries.
✅ dnSpy / DotPeek – Analyze .NET applications.
✅ JADX / JEB – Decompile Java-based applications.
✅ PEStudio / CFF Explorer – Inspect Windows executables.

Steps:
1️⃣ Decompile EXE, DLL, or JAR files.
2️⃣ Search for hardcoded passwords, encryption keys.
3️⃣ Identify dangerous functions (system(), eval()).
4️⃣ Modify and recompile binaries for security bypass.

### 🚀 Step 6: Exploitation & Post-Exploitation
Tools:
✅ Metasploit – Exploit common vulnerabilities.
✅ DLL Hijacking – Load malicious DLLs into the application.
✅ Process Injection – Inject payloads into running processes.
✅ WinDbg / x64dbg – Debug and analyze memory in real-time.

Steps:
1️⃣ Attempt DLL Hijacking (Find unsigned DLLs).
2️⃣ Inject malicious payloads into memory.
3️⃣ Exploit buffer overflows and command injections.
4️⃣ Test for Privilege Escalation via Windows Registry, File Permissions.
