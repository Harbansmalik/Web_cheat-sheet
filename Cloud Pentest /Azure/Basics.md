## `Root Management | Mangement Groups | Subscription | Resource Groups | Resource`

## Root Managements
A top-level Management Group is known as the Root Management Group. Initially, only an Azure AD Global Administrator can access this root-level group, but access can be elevated as needed. Here are some important details about it: 

- It is named the Tenant root group, although this name can be modified. 

- The Root Management Group cannot be relocated or removed. 

- All other Management Groups within the Azure AD are situated beneath the Root Management Group. 

- The Root Management Group is accessible to all users on Azure. 

- Only one Root Management Group is permitted per Azure AD tenant. 

- Newly created Subscriptions are automatically placed within the Root Management Group.

## Management Groups

- Contains other management groups or subscription.
- Control RBAC(Role-Based Access Control) and Azure Policy.
- Management group support upto 6-level of depth.

## Azure Subscriptions

- Logical container where resources (VMs, DBs) can be run and billed.
- Permissions applies at the subscription level are inherited to all the resources inside the subscription.

## Resource Groups
- Container that holds related resources that you want to manage as a group.
- Resources must be inside a resource group and can belong only to a group and if a resource group is deleted, all the resource inside it are also deleted.

  
## Resource

Every resource in Azure has an Azure Resource ID that identifies it.

The format of an Azure Resource ID is as follows:

`/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/{resourceType}/{resourceName}`

For a virtual machine named myVM in a resource group myResourceGroup under subscription ID 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012, the Azure Resource ID looks like this:

`/subscriptions/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM`

 ## ` Azure | Entra ID | Azure AD Domain Services `

 ### AZURE:
 Cloud computing platform offering a wide range of services, VMs, database, AI and storage.

 ### Entra ID:
 Identity and access management service designed to handle authentication, authorization and user access control.

 ### Entra Domain Services (formerly Azure AD DS):

 ## 2 Types of Groups:
 - `Security:-` This type of groups is used to give member access to applications, resources and assign licenses.
 - `Microsoft 365:-` This type of group is used for collaboration, giving member access to a shared mailbox, calendar, files, share point. Group members can only be users. Have email address with the domain of the Entra ID tenant. 

## 2 Types of membership

- `Assignes:` Allow to add manually add specific members to a group.
- `Dynamic Membership:` Automattically manager membership using rules, updating group inclusion when members attribute changes.

## Service Principals

- Identity created for use with applications, hosted services and automated tools to access resources.
