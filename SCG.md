A rate limit vulnerability in an API occurs when there are insufficient restrictions on the number of requests, allowing attackers to perform brute-force attacks, data scraping, or overwhelm the server, potentially leading to security breaches, data loss, or service disruption.

Detect and block abnormal traffic patterns in real time.
Enforce identity-based limits and revoke abused keys.


APIs can be exploited for mass data extraction or unfair usage.
Unrestricted requests can overwhelm servers, causing outages.
Without rate limiting, attackers can rapidly guess credentials or tokens.
