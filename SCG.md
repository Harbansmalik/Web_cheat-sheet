API rate limiting controls the number of requests a user or system can make within a set time frame, protecting against abuse, brute force attacks, and server overload. It enhances performance, ensures fair usage, and improves application security.

Detect and block abnormal traffic patterns in real time.
Enforce identity-based limits and revoke abused keys.


APIs can be exploited for mass data extraction or unfair usage.
Unrestricted requests can overwhelm servers, causing outages.
Without rate limiting, attackers can rapidly guess credentials or tokens.
