## GraphQL:
Flexible query language; single endpoint; clients specify data needs; efficient for complex queries.

## REST: 
Resource-oriented; multiple endpoints; uses standard HTTP methods; stateless and cacheable.

## SOAP: 
Protocol-based; relies on XML; strict standards; supports WS-* for security and transactions; more rigid than REST and GraphQL.
