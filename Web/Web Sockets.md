# WEB SOCKETS

WebSockets provide full-duplex, real-time communication between a client and a server over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP, which follows a request-response model, WebSockets allow persistent bidirectional communication without the overhead of multiple HTTP requests.

## web socket hijacking

If the WebSocket connection is not authenticated or protected properly, an attacker can reuse your session or connect to the server as you â€” just like stealing a session cookie.
when an attacker takes control of a WebSocket connection between a user's browser and a server to steal data, impersonate the user, or interfere with communication.
