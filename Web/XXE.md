# XXE

XXE, or XML External Entity, is a security vulnerability in web applications that allows attackers to interfere with XML data processing, potentially leading to unauthorized file access and remote code execution. XXE vulnerabilities arise when applications improperly process XML input, enabling attackers to exploit external entities for unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or executing malicious commands on the server.
